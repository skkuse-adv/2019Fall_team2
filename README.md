## Introduction

* The major goal of this team project is to generate enhanced architecture desigin finally after executing the below steps. 
   * Choose one among popular target systems (e.g., personnalization) 
      * Target system: Personalization, Fitts (https://www.fitts.co.kr)
   * Milestone: https://github.com/skkuse-adv/2019Fall_team2/milestones
      * :necktie: Milestone 1: Write the proposal document after analyzing briefly target system
      * :necktie: Milestone 2: Write the system requirement document for a requirement specification
      * :necktie: Milestone 3: Write the system design document for a target system architecture
      * :necktie: Milestone 4: Write the enhanced system design based on ADD to propose new architecture model finally.
